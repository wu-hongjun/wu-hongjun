    <br>😄 Hi there! I'm Hongjun Wu, an art student at University of Washington ヽ(✿ﾟ▽ﾟ)ノ!<br>
    <br>🔭 I’m currently working on <a href="https://github.com/Errrneist/AnimKit">AnimKit</a>, an open-source Maya toolkit written in Python.<br>
    <br>😉 I also work on many different things on the side, like hackintosh dev, CAE, etc.<br>
    <br>🌱 I’m interested in machine learning (I TAed for that course many times) and animation! <br>
    <br>💬 Ask me just about anything you can think of!<br>
    <br>⚡ Fun fact: I got rejected by UWCSE five times in a role :))) It's ok they don't deserve me.<br>
